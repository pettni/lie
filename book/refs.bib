  abstract = {In this paper, we provide speciﬁc and practical approaches to associate uncertainty with 4 × 4 transformation matrices, which is a common representation for pose variables in 3-D space. We show constraint-sensitive means of perturbing transformation matrices using their associated exponential-map generators and demonstrate these tools on three simple-yet-important estimation problems: 1) propagating uncertainty through a compound pose change, 2) fusing multiple measurements of a pose (e.g., for use in pose-graph relaxation), and 3) propagating uncertainty on poses (and landmarks) through a nonlinear camera model. The contribution of the paper is the presentation of the theoretical tools, which can be applied in the analysis of many problems involving 3-D pose and point variables.},
