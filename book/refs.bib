  abstract     = {The use of multiple sensors for ego-motion estimation is an approach often used to provide more accurate and robust results. However, when representing ego-motion as a discrete series of poses, fusing information of unsynchronized sensors is not straightforward. The framework described in this paper aims to provide a uniﬁed solution for solving ego-motion estimation problems involving high-rate unsynchronized devices. Instead of a discrete-time pose representation, we present a continuous-time formulation that makes use of cumulative cubic B-Splines parameterized in the Lie Algebra of the group {SE}3. This trajectory representation has several advantages for sensor fusion: (1) it has local control, which enables sliding window implementations; (2) it is C2 continuous, allowing predictions of inertial measurements; (3) it closely matches torque-minimal motions; (4) it has no singularities when representing rotations; (5) it easily handles measurements from multiple sensors arriving a different times when timestamps are available; and (6) it deals with rolling shutter cameras naturally. We apply this continuous-time framework to visual–inertial simultaneous localization and mapping and show that it can also be used to calibrate the entire system.},

We show constraint-sensitive means of perturbing transformation matrices using their associated exponential-map generators and demonstrate these tools on three simple-yet-important estimation problems: 1) propagating uncertainty through a compound pose change, 2) fusing multiple measurements of a pose (e.g., for use in pose-graph relaxation), and 3) propagating uncertainty on poses (and landmarks) through a nonlinear camera model. The contribution of the paper is the presentation of the theoretical tools, which can be applied in the analysis of many problems involving 3-D pose and point variables.},

This paper shows that all such systems can be embedded in an equivariant system using a velocity extension. We propose a novel ﬁlter, the Equivariant Filter ({EqF}), by linearising global error dynamics derived from the equivariance of the embedding system and applying a Riccati observer to these error dynamics. In cases where the system output is also equivariant the {EqF} leads to linearised dynamics with a constant output matrix. The work is motivated by an example application that is intractable to prior published invariant ﬁlter design methodologies.},

It is shown, under various technical conditions, that nonlinear control systems with symmetries admit local and/or global decompositions in terms of lower dimensional subsystems and feedback loops. The structure of the individual subsystems is dependent on the structure of the symmetry group; for example, if the symmetry group is Abelian, one of the subsystems is a quadrature. An additional feature of the decomposition is that the state-space dimensions of the subsystems sum to the state-space dimension of the original system.},
